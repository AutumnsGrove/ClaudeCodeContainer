# Claude Code: Next Steps & Implementation Guide

## üìã Session Summary

This project was initialized in a single session with Claude 4.1 Opus. The following has been completed:

‚úÖ **Completed:**
- Git repository initialized
- Project structure organized (src/, scripts/, docs/)
- Docker files removed (focusing on native Apple container framework)
- Documentation updated to reflect Apple container framework focus
- .gitignore configured for workspace and container files
- Initial commit created

## üéØ Project Overview

**Goal:** Build a secure, containerized development environment for Claude Code using Apple's native container framework.

**Framework:** [Apple Container Framework](https://github.com/apple/container)

**Current Status:** Early scaffolding phase - architecture planned, implementation needed

## üöÄ Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Research & Foundation (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Research Apple Container Framework**
   - Study the [Apple container repository](https://github.com/apple/container)
   - Understand the API and capabilities
   - Document key components and patterns
   - Compare with Apple's Virtualization.framework

2. **Define Container Architecture**
   - Design the container lifecycle (create, start, stop, attach)
   - Plan workspace mounting strategy
   - Design network configuration for internet access
   - Plan resource allocation (CPU, memory, storage)

3. **Create Technical Specification**
   - Document container configuration format
   - Define workspace structure
   - Specify security boundaries
   - Plan MCP server integration

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

1. **Implement `src/init-container.swift`**
   - Container creation and configuration
   - Workspace directory mounting (VirtioFS or similar)
   - Network setup for internet access
   - Resource allocation logic
   - Error handling and logging

2. **Implement Setup Scripts**
   - Update `scripts/setup.sh` to use Apple container framework
   - Remove Docker fallback logic from `scripts/setup-unified.sh`
   - Implement proper workspace initialization
   - Add prerequisite checking

3. **Implement Management Script**
   - Update `scripts/manage.sh` for Apple containers
   - Implement container lifecycle commands
   - Add backup and restore functionality
   - Implement file import/export utilities

### Phase 3: Container Environment

1. **Base System Setup**
   - Create Ubuntu base image configuration
   - Implement package installation automation
   - Configure Python 3.11, Node.js, Git
   - Set up Homebrew and UV

2. **Claude Code Integration**
   - Install Claude Code CLI
   - Configure MCP servers (Sequential Thinking, Zen)
   - Set up workspace aliases and shortcuts
   - Create welcome message and MOTD

3. **Workspace Configuration**
   - Implement workspace directory structure
   - Configure git defaults
   - Set up shell environment (.bashrc, aliases)
   - Create preset prompt templates

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation

1. **Testing**
   - Test container creation and startup
   - Verify workspace mounting and persistence
   - Test MCP server functionality
   - Validate network access
   - Test resource limits

2. **Documentation**
   - Write comprehensive setup guide
   - Document troubleshooting steps
   - Create usage examples
   - Add architecture diagrams

## üîß Technical Considerations

### Key Challenges to Address

1. **Apple Container Framework vs. Virtualization.framework**
   - The Apple container framework may be in early stages
   - Might need to fall back to or integrate with Virtualization.framework
   - Research which APIs are available and stable

2. **File System Sharing**
   - Implement efficient workspace mounting
   - Ensure proper permissions between host and container
   - Handle large file operations gracefully

3. **Network Configuration**
   - Enable internet access for package installation and Claude API
   - Implement proper network isolation
   - Consider DNS configuration

4. **Resource Management**
   - Implement configurable memory/CPU limits
   - Handle storage allocation dynamically
   - Monitor resource usage

## üí° Recommendations for Claude Code

### Using Planning Mode

When starting the next session with planning mode:

1. **Start with Research**
   - Use subagents to research the Apple container framework
   - Have one subagent study the repository structure
   - Have another subagent research Virtualization.framework integration
   - Consolidate findings before implementation

2. **Break Down Implementation**
   - Tackle one component at a time (container creation ‚Üí workspace mounting ‚Üí network ‚Üí etc.)
   - Create small, testable increments
   - Commit frequently following GIT_COMMIT_STYLE.md

3. **Use Multiple Subagents**
   - **Research Subagent:** Study Apple's container APIs and examples
   - **Implementation Subagent:** Write Swift code for container management
   - **Testing Subagent:** Validate each component as it's built
   - **Documentation Subagent:** Update docs as features are implemented

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Start Simple**
   - First goal: Create and start a basic container
   - Then: Add workspace mounting
   - Then: Add network access
   - Finally: Add full environment setup

2. **Incremental Testing**
   - Test each component independently
   - Create integration tests as you go
   - Don't move to next phase until current phase works

3. **Document as You Go**
   - Update README.md with actual capabilities
   - Add inline code documentation
   - Create troubleshooting guides based on issues encountered

### Code Style & Commits

- Follow [Conventional Commits](docs/GIT_COMMIT_STYLE.md)
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Commit logical units of work
- Types to use:
  - `feat:` for new functionality
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation
  - `refactor:` for code restructuring
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Docker Removed:** This project does NOT use Docker. Focus on native Apple frameworks only.

2. **Workspace Isolation:** The workspace at `~/ClaudeCodeWorkspace/` should be completely isolated from the host system except for explicit mount points.

3. **Security First:** Maintain strong security boundaries. Review SECURITY.md for requirements.

4. **Subagent Coordination:** When using multiple subagents, ensure they share context and findings to avoid duplication.

5. **Fallback Considerations:** If Apple's container framework is too limited or unstable, consider using Virtualization.framework directly with a custom container implementation.

## üé¨ Getting Started (Next Session)

**Recommended first command:**
```bash
# Start with research
# Use planning mode to break down the research phase
# Assign subagents to different research areas
```

**First Implementation Goal:**
Create a minimal working container that:
- Starts an Ubuntu VM using Apple's framework
- Mounts a single workspace directory
- Can be accessed via terminal

**Success Criteria:**
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh          # Creates container
./scripts/manage.sh start   # Starts container
./scripts/manage.sh attach  # Connects to container shell
ls /workspace               # Shows mounted directories
```

## ü§ù Good Luck!

This is an exciting project combining native macOS virtualization with Claude Code's capabilities. Take it step by step, research thoroughly, and don't hesitate to experiment with the Apple container framework.

Remember: Quality over speed. Build it right, build it secure, build it documented.
