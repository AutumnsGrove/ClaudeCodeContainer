# Apple Container Framework Research Metaprompt

> **For Claude in Research Mode**
>
> This prompt guides comprehensive research of Apple's container framework to create actionable documentation for development.

---

## üéØ Mission

Research and document Apple's container framework (https://github.com/apple/container) to create comprehensive, actionable reference materials that enable immediate development of a native macOS container solution for Claude Code.

## üìã Your Task

You are Claude in **research mode**. Your goal is to deeply understand Apple's container framework and create documentation that will allow Claude Code (in a future session) to implement a secure containerized environment **without** needing to do additional research.

## üî¨ Research Strategy

### Use Multiple Subagents in Parallel

Deploy specialized subagents to research different aspects simultaneously:

1. **Repository Analysis Subagent**
   - Clone and examine https://github.com/apple/container
   - Analyze directory structure and code organization
   - Identify key source files and their purposes
   - Map out the architecture and components
   - Document build process and dependencies

2. **API Documentation Subagent**
   - Extract all public APIs and interfaces
   - Document function signatures, parameters, return types
   - Identify Swift/Objective-C interop requirements
   - Map API usage patterns and common workflows
   - Document configuration options and defaults

3. **Examples & Usage Patterns Subagent**
   - Find example code in the repository
   - Search for tests that demonstrate usage
   - Look for documentation or README files
   - Identify common patterns and best practices
   - Extract minimal working examples

4. **Integration Research Subagent**
   - Research how this relates to Apple's Virtualization.framework
   - Investigate macOS version requirements
   - Document required entitlements and permissions
   - Research file system sharing mechanisms (VirtioFS, etc.)
   - Investigate network configuration options

5. **Alternative Approaches Subagent**
   - If the container framework is incomplete/unstable, research fallback options
   - Investigate using Virtualization.framework directly
   - Research other native macOS container solutions
   - Document pros/cons of each approach

## üìä Expected Deliverables

Create the following documentation in the `research/` directory:

### 1. `FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW.md`
**Purpose:** High-level understanding of what the framework is and how it works

**Contents:**
- What is Apple's container framework?
- How does it differ from Docker/containerd?
- Relationship to Virtualization.framework
- System requirements (macOS version, architecture)
- Current maturity level and stability assessment
- Recommended use cases

### 2. `API_REFERENCE.md`
**Purpose:** Complete API documentation for implementation

**Contents:**
- All public classes and protocols
- Key functions with full signatures
- Configuration structures and options
- Error types and handling
- Code examples for each major API
- Swift vs. Objective-C usage notes

### 3. `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
**Purpose:** Step-by-step guide to implementing containers

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites and setup
- Container lifecycle (create ‚Üí start ‚Üí stop ‚Üí destroy)
- Workspace mounting and file sharing
- Network configuration for internet access
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, storage)
- Security configuration
- Logging and debugging
- Complete minimal working example

### 4. `EXAMPLES/`
**Purpose:** Working code samples

**Contents:**

- `container-with-workspace.swift` - Container with mounted directories
- `container-with-network.swift` - Container with network access
- `full-example.swift` - Complete implementation with all features
- Each example should be self-contained and runnable

### 5. `ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md`
**Purpose:** Recommendation on best approach

**Contents:**
- Assessment of Apple container framework viability
- If viable: implementation roadmap
- If not viable: recommended alternative approach
- Trade-offs and considerations
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### 6. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
**Purpose:** Common issues and solutions

**Contents:**
- Known limitations of the framework
- Common error messages and fixes
- Debugging techniques
- Performance considerations
- Platform-specific gotchas

## üîç Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (Parallel)
- **All subagents start simultaneously**
- Each focuses on their specialized area
- Time limit: Comprehensive but efficient
- Goal: Broad understanding of the framework

### Phase 2: Deep Dive (Sequential)
- **Consolidate findings from Phase 1**
- Identify gaps in knowledge
- Deploy targeted research to fill gaps
- Goal: Complete technical understanding

### Phase 3: Synthesis (Single Focus)
- **Create comprehensive documentation**
- Write all deliverable documents
- Ensure consistency across documents
- Validate with working examples
- Goal: Production-ready documentation

### Phase 4: Validation (Final Check)
- **Review all documentation**
- Ensure Claude Code can implement without further research
- Check for completeness and clarity
- Add any missing pieces
- Goal: Ready-to-implement documentation set

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Your research is complete when:

1. ‚úÖ All deliverable documents are created
2. ‚úÖ At least one working code example exists
3. ‚úÖ Implementation path is clear and actionable
4. ‚úÖ Alternative approach documented if primary approach not viable
5. ‚úÖ Claude Code could start implementation immediately after reading docs
6. ‚úÖ No additional research would be needed during implementation

## üéØ Key Questions to Answer

### Technical Questions:
- What are the exact Swift/Objective-C APIs for creating containers?
- How do you mount host directories into containers?
- How do you configure network access?
- How do you set resource limits?
- What's the container image format?
- How do you execute commands in containers?
- How do you attach to a running container?

### Practical Questions:
- What's the minimum macOS version required?
- What entitlements/permissions are needed?
- Can this run without sudo/root?
- What's the performance compared to Docker?
- Is the framework stable enough for production use?
- Are there any major bugs or limitations?

### Decision Questions:
- Should we use this framework or fall back to Virtualization.framework?
- What's the learning curve?
- What are the risks?
- What's the maintenance burden?

## üí° Research Tips

1. **Start with the Repository**
   - README and docs are gold
   - Tests show real usage
   - Look for example directories

2. **Check Git History**
   - Recent commits show active development
   - Issue tracker shows problems and solutions
   - PRs show how contributors use the framework

3. **Look for Related Projects**
   - Search GitHub for projects using the framework
   - Check Apple Developer forums
   - Look for blog posts or articles

4. **Be Pragmatic**
   - If the framework is too immature, say so
   - Recommend alternatives if needed
   - Don't force a solution that won't work

5. **Think Like a Developer**
   - What would you need to know to implement this?
   - What examples would be most helpful?
   - What pitfalls should be avoided?

## üìù Documentation Style

- **Be concise but complete** - No fluff, all substance
- **Code over prose** - Show, don't just tell
- **Practical examples** - Real code that works
- **Clear structure** - Easy to navigate and reference
- **Actionable** - Every doc should enable immediate action

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Read this entire prompt carefully**
2. **Deploy your subagents** (use Task tool with multiple agents in parallel)
3. **Coordinate findings** as subagents complete
4. **Synthesize documentation** based on all research
5. **Validate with examples** - ensure everything works
6. **Create final deliverables** in `research/` directory

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **This is research, not implementation** - Don't write production code yet
- **Focus on Apple's framework** - Not Docker, not other solutions (unless fallback needed)
- **Be thorough** - Future Claude Code session depends on this
- **Be honest** - If framework won't work, say so and recommend alternatives
- **Create examples** - Working code is worth 1000 words

## üé¨ Final Output

When complete, the `research/` directory should contain everything needed to:
1. Understand the Apple container framework
2. Implement a container solution
3. Troubleshoot issues
4. Make architectural decisions

Future Claude Code session should be able to read these docs and start coding immediately without any additional research.
