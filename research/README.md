# Research Directory

This directory contains research documentation for the Apple container framework.

## Purpose

Before implementing the container solution, comprehensive research must be conducted to understand Apple's container framework and create actionable documentation for development.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Run Research Session

Use **RESEARCH_PROMPT.md** with Claude in research mode:

1. Open a new Claude conversation (NOT Claude Code)
2. Paste or reference the RESEARCH_PROMPT.md content
3. Let Claude deploy subagents and conduct parallel research
4. Claude will create comprehensive documentation in this directory

### Step 2: Review Research Output

After research is complete, this directory should contain:

- âœ… `FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW.md` - High-level understanding
- âœ… `API_REFERENCE.md` - Complete API documentation
- âœ… `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step implementation guide
- âœ… `EXAMPLES/` - Working code samples
- âœ… `ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md` - Recommended approach
- âœ… `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and solutions

### Step 3: Begin Implementation

Once research is complete, start Claude Code in planning mode and use the documentation to begin implementation.

    â”œâ”€â”€ container-with-network.swift
    â””â”€â”€ full-example.swift
```

## Current Status

ðŸ“‹ **Status:** Research not yet conducted

**Next Action:** Run RESEARCH_PROMPT.md with Claude in research mode

## Notes

- Research documentation should be comprehensive enough that implementation can begin without further research
- All code examples should be tested and working
- If Apple's container framework is not viable, research should document alternative approaches
