# Apple Container Framework Research Archive

**Status:** ARCHIVED
**Date Archived:** October 30, 2025
**Research Conducted:** October 8, 2025
**Reason for Archive:** Project pivoted to Docker Desktop implementation

---

## Why This Research Was Archived

This directory contains research and implementation work on Apple's native container framework. After thorough evaluation, the ClaudeCodeContainer project pivoted to using **Docker Desktop** for the following reasons:

### Key Decision Factors

1. **Apple Framework Not Production Ready (v0.5.0)**
   - 177 open issues with critical bugs
   - Missing essential features (volumes, Docker builds)
   - Race conditions and stability issues
   - Breaking changes expected until v1.0.0 release
   - Only compatible with macOS 26+ (Sequoia)

2. **Docker Desktop Provides Better Near-Term Solution**
   - Production-ready and battle-tested
   - Complete Docker compatibility
   - Extensive ecosystem support
   - Familiar tooling for most developers
   - Works across multiple macOS versions

3. **Timeline Considerations**
   - Apple Container Framework v1.0.0 expected in 2026+
   - Project needs stable solution now (October 2025)
   - Can revisit native framework in future if/when mature

## When to Revisit This Research

Consider re-evaluating the Apple Container Framework when:

1. **Version 1.0.0 releases** (expected 2026+)
2. **Critical issues are resolved** (monitor GitHub issue count)
3. **Community adoption increases** (production usage reports)
4. **Essential features are added** (volumes, builds, networking)
5. **Stability improves** (race conditions, crashes eliminated)
